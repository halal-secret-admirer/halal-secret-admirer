The message read:<br><br><div class='letter-body'>\"Dear Talha,<br>I love you. You are the coolest man on campus. You are loved.<br>Love, your secret admirer ðŸ’˜ðŸ’˜ðŸ’˜\"</div><br><span class='forensic-detail'>Forensic note: Written with Person X's black Parker Jotter (bench neighbor's pen).</span> Clever girl - you left no traces but borrowed from my ecosystem."
